# WhatsApp-SendMessage
Javascript script to automatically send messages to a person on your contact list.

### NOTE: 
This is technically spam. I created this just to see if it was doable and also to annoy my friend for 10 minutes. It has been said that WhatsApp could ban you for usage of these spam scripts. I am not held responsible for any actions or usage of this script.

### TIP: 
You could add a timer to automatically send a message `x` times within `y` timeframe using `setTimeout` function. Modify the `sendMessage` function to take in an array of cute messages to randomly send your parents/significant other every day at a set time. I did not give you this idea. :P
